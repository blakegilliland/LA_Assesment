# LA_Assesment

Statistical Analysis of FGCU Learning Assistant Program

The research paper is entitled "LA_Paper" and is found in the "LA Data" folder along with the associated .csv files. Also included in this folder is the "LA-analysis" R Markdown file which was where some of the prelimanary analysis was conducted. You'll see similar R code there, but not much text. There are both .md and .Rmd files for those who may or may not use R Markdown.

The "LA_Paper_files" and the "LA-analysis_files" folders in "LA Data" are automatically generated and contain the visualizations from the respective .Rmd files but as LaTeX output. These are needed to get the visuals in the .md files for those who do not use .Rmd.

Make sure that if you do run it as an .Rmd that all associated .cvs's, are included in your directory when you run it or else it won't work. Similarly, make sure that the paths for the images are correct for wherever you choose to keep them. The .bib file is in the header. Make sure that too is accounted for in your directory when you run.

These files (for .Rmd) include:

* "LA_DFW_Data.csv"
* "PairedData.csv"
* "TAvLA.png"
* "ref.bib"

Files needed to run .md files:
All files in "LA_Paper_files"/"LA-analysis_files", with respect to the .md file you're interested in running.
