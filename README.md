Statistical Analysis of FGCU Learning Assistant Program

The files are in .md format but are meant to be ran as .Rmd's. It shouldn't really matter but for those of you with R Studio who are familiar with R Markdown feel free to convert it to .Rmd. 

Make sure that if you run it as an .Rmd that all associated .cvs's, are included in your directory when you run it or else it won't work. Similarly, make sure that the paths for the images are correct for wherever you choose to keep them. The .bib file is in the header. Make sure that too is accounted for in your directory when you run.

These files include:

* "LA_DFW_Data.csv"
* "PairedData.csv"
* "TAvLA.png"
* "ref.bib"
