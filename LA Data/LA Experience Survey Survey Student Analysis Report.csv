So, I do believe that if I wasn't here, the students, and I can think of two in particular, would have struggled more. They could have seemed out help from other places, but I feel me being here made it easier for them to study/review.",4 - Somewhat agree,"I felt I did things throughout the semester that weren't necessarily required of me to do. For example, the study sessions. Little things, and maybe I was suppose to do that. But I enjoyed doing more so it wasn't an issue.",5 - Completely agree,"I would like to be a teacher in the future, so being able to see things from more of the teachers perspective definitely helped me.",9,"Some days students didn't have problems, and some days they had lots. With math, it's just hit or miss.",9,"I feel like I matured in the ways of a student. I can see what I used to do because I see it in the students. I also did learn study habits, and when to start and stop studying as well."
